    <h2>Disease Overview</h2>
    <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2016/06/08/06/mcdc7_diseased_kidney-8col.jpg" alt="Kidney Anatomy Diagram">
    <p><strong>What is Chronic Kidney Disease?</strong></p>
    <p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where kidney function gradually deteriorates, impairing the body's ability to filter waste and excess fluids. CKD is classified into five stages based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with Stage 5 indicating complete or near-complete kidney failure. Left unmanaged, CKD can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, bone mineral disorders, and the need for dialysis or transplant.</p>

    <p><strong>Primary Causes and At-Risk Populations:</strong></p>
    <p>The most common causes of CKD include uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension. Risk factors include advanced age, obesity, smoking, family history of kidney disease, and ethnicity (e.g., African American, Native American, Hispanic).</p>

    <p><strong>Symptoms and Diagnosis:</strong> In early stages, CKD may be asymptomatic. Later stages may include fatigue, edema, nausea, high blood pressure, and reduced urine output. Diagnosis involves blood and urine tests, including GFR and proteinuria.</p>

    <p><strong>Why I Chose This Topic:</strong> CKD fascinates me due to the vital role nutrition plays in its management. As a future nurse, I aim to use nutrition as a tool for empowerment, helping patients live healthier and delay disease progression.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition Therapy for CKD</h2>
    <img src="https://www.davita.com/-/media/davita/images/diet-and-nutrition/tips-and-resources/renal-diet-overview.png" alt="CKD Dietary Guidelines">
    <p>Dietary management is key in slowing the progression of CKD and reducing symptom burden. Recommendations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limit Sodium:</strong> &lt;2300 mg/day. Avoid deli meats, canned soups, processed snacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Control Potassium:</strong> Avoid bananas, oranges, potatoes. Choose berries, grapes, green beans.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Phosphorus:</strong> Avoid dairy, nuts, colas. Use phosphorus binders if prescribed.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate Protein:</strong> Focus on high-quality protein in correct amounts (chicken, eggs, tofu).</li>
      <li><strong>Fluid Monitoring:</strong> Especially in later stages or for patients with edema.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Application</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/7715/9031/files/RenalDietMealPlan.png" alt="Sample CKD Meal Plan">
    <h3>Sample Menu:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Egg whites, white toast with unsalted butter, applesauce</li>
      <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Grilled chicken, white rice, steamed green beans</li>
      <li><strong>Snack:</strong> Rice cakes and grapes</li>
      <li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Pasta with zucchini and garlic, canned pears</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use fresh herbs to replace salt.</li>
      <li>Choose homemade meals over processed/prepackaged ones.</li>
      <li>Ask restaurants for no-sodium, sauce-free options.</li>

    <h2>Mock Interview</h2>
    <p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Maria, 62, diagnosed with Stage 3 CKD</p>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Diagnosed 5 years ago following uncontrolled hypertension. Initial reaction included anxiety, frustration, and confusion regarding her new diet. She missed bananas and tomatoes most.</p>
    <p><strong>Early Challenges:</strong> Grocery shopping became stressful, and eating with family was isolating. Learning how to read nutrition labels took months of trial and error.</p>
    <p><strong>Now:</strong> Maria has adapted. She meal preps weekly, avoids high-risk foods, and teaches her grandchildren healthy cooking. She notes low-sodium items are more accessible now, though still costly.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This experience made me more sensitive to what patients endure daily. It reinforced that food is not just medicineâ€”it's culture, comfort, and choice. Nurses must meet patients where they are with understanding and realistic solutions.</p>
